# Alabama Cropland and Fire Analysis (2012–2024)

This repository provides geospatial datasets for the state of Alabama, combining cropland classification data from the USDA and fire detection data from NASA. The datasets are structured to support spatial analysis of agricultural land use, wildfire activity, and environmental risk across Alabama.

## Dataset Overview

- Folder: `cropland-rasters/` (placeholder only; data hosted externally)

### Fire Detection Data (NASA VIIRS)
- Source: NASA FIRMS – VIIRS Active Fire Product
- Format: ESRI Shapefile (.shp and associated files)
- Organization: Monthly shapefiles grouped by year

## Applications

- Monitoring cropland distribution and change
- Mapping seasonal wildfire exposure in agricultural areas
- Supporting crop-fire interaction analysis and environmental planning
- Providing input for early warning systems and land use models

## Relevance to National Interest

This project integrates authoritative data from the USDA and NASA, aligning with national objectives in:
- Agricultural productivity and food system monitoring
- Wildfire risk assessment and climate resilience
- Environmental hazard mitigation and resource planning
- Public access to science-based decision support tools
